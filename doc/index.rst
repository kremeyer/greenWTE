greenWTE - Solve the Wigner Transport Equation with a source term!
==================================================================

greenWTE is a Python package to solve the Wigner Transport Equation (WTE) in spatial and temporal Fourier space
for arbitrary source terms. This allows to compute thermal conductivities from bulk to nanoscale, from static to
high frequency regimes. Beyond that it can be used to study the response of materials to arbitrary heat sources.

Derived from the Wigner formulation of quantum mechanics, the WTE describes heat transport in terms of particlelike
and wavelike conduction mechanisms. The full and very detailed derivation can be found in the work by Simoncelli,
Marzari and Mauri in their paper `"Wigner Formulation of Thermal Transport in Solids" [Phys. Rev. X 12 (2022)]
<WTE_paper>`_.
